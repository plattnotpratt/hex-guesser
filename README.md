## General Game Requirements:
- This game will be created for the browser
  - Optimization for browser should be paramount.
  - Take advantage of browser tricks to keep the game quick even on limited computers.
- Create an image with a specified color. *Can't just use a div and color it as we are looking for the general and it would be too easy to cheat*
  - This image should have no indication of what the initial color is eg. **hash the file**.
  - The image should be small so that we can take advantage of speed.
